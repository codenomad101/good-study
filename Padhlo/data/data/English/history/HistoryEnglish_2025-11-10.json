(2) is correct; the seal depicting a three-faced deity seated in a yogic posture and surrounded by animals is widely interpreted by scholars as a 'proto-Shiva'.

However, the 'Nizamat' (civil administration and criminal justice) was left in the hands of the Nawab of Bengal. This created a system where the British had power and money without responsibility, while the Nawab had responsibility without power or resources, leading to a complete breakdown of governance and the Bengal Famine of 1770.",

      "CorrectAnswer": "1 and 3 only",
      "Explanation": "The Cabinet Mission was the last attempt to keep India united. (1) It proposed a complex 3-tier system (Provinces, Groups A/B/C, and a Union Centre) where the Centre would control only Defence, Foreign Affairs, and Communications. (2) It explicitly *rejected* the demand for a separate, sovereign Pakistan, which is why the Muslim League later rejected the plan.

      "Explanation": "The British decided to hold public trials of INA officers (notably P.K. Sahgal, G.S. Dhillon, and Shah Nawaz Khan - a Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim) at the Red Fort. This backfired spectacularly. The trials generated a massive wave of sympathy. Congress formed a defence committee (including Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai), and there were widespread protests. This popular support, and the subsequent naval mutiny (RIN, 1946), convinced the British that their control over the Indian armed forces was no longer secure.",

        "CorrectAnswer": "Fazl Ali Commission",
        "Explanation": "The Dhar Commission and JVP Committee had both rejected 'language' as the basis for reorganization. However, after the death of Potti Sriramulu and the creation of Andhra state, the government was forced to reconsider. The Fazl Ali Commission (1953) was set up, and it broadly accepted language as the basis for reorganizing states, leading to the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, which created 14 states and 6 UTs.",

He then formed the 'Forward Bloc' as a new party within the Congress to consolidate the leftist and revolutionary factions.",
