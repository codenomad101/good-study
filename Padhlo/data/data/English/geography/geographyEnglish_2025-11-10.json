    "Explanation": "(1) and (2) are correct. Laterite soil is formed by intense 'leaching' due to high rainfall, which washes away silica, leaving iron and aluminum oxides (giving it a red color). This process also removes humus. (3) is incorrect; because it is poor in nutrients, it is not very fertile. It is suitable for crops like cashew, tapioca, tea, and coffee with heavy use of fertilizers.",
