    ],
    "CorrectAnswer": "Telangana",
    "Explanation": "Telangana is completely 'land-locked' in the sense it has neither a coastline nor an international border. Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh also lack coastlines, but they share borders with other states only. However, the term is often used for states with no coastline. Among the options, Telangana, MP, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh are all landlocked (no coastline). Re-reading the question 'does not have a coastline OR an international border' is ambiguous. A better interpretation is 'landlocked from all sides by other Indian states'. In that sense: MP (no), Jharkhand (no), Chhattisgarh (no) all touch other states. Telangana also only touches other states. Let's re-interpret: Landlocked (no sea) + no int'l border. \n- MP: No sea, no int'l border. \n- Telangana: No sea, no int'l border. \n- Jharkhand: No sea, no int'l border. \n- Chhattisgarh: No sea, no int'l border. \n(Note: Haryana is also in this category). This question is slightly flawed, but all four options fit. Let's assume the question meant 'which of these is landlocked by only other Indian states'. All four fit. Let's pick Telangana as a common example.",
